# Instagram Inspired Application for Pet Anthusiasts
Designed & Developed By: Scott Leonard aka Michael Wells

### Petstagram is a social media platform for people obsessed with their pets.

We all love our pets, right?  

### What It Does

1. Allows you to upload hi-definition photos of your pets directly from your device's stored image album or camera.

2. Follow like minded people.

## What inspired me to create this app.

> If every memeber of your family can have a social media presence why not your pet? 

I never knew I wanted to become a programmer until I ran into a brick wall at work. As the person in charge of keeping track of inventory at my job I found myself both annoyed and overwhelmed at the disorganized state of affairs. The problem was that the person who actually made inventory purchases was extremely disorganized â€” forgetting to document purchases or simply misplacing our supplier contact information. \
This situation pushed me to seek out a solution. Now, I know what you're thinking; I could have just downloaded an app for inventory management or persuaded my employeers to purchase one, right? \
Well, wrong! That's what the 99% would do. I'm trying to be an exceptional person and so I set out on the task of learning to program.

This is my very first project and I am proud of what I've managed to accomplish with no prior iOS developement experience and not following any tutorials. Additionally, I was able to put my designing skills to work. All of the artwork, UI, and UX I designed myself using Adobe Illustrator & XD.
